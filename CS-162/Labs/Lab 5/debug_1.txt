How I fixed debug_1.txt:

I ran it first and saw the segmentation fault.

I then used GDB to make a breakpoint at main and ran it step by step.

I found that the error came right after line 19. I saw that in line 21, the int pointer b was used without it
pointing to something. I made it point to a and changed the *b to a b in the print statement so it would be
correct.
