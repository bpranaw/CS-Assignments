How I figured out the issue in debug_2:

I used GDB to make a breakpoint at main.

I then ran to the breakpoint and used step to go through line by line

Then when it came to the factorial function, I used print to show the value of the variables

I used step to continue running through the factorial loop and kept checking the values of n and fact

I noticed it was multiplying it all by zero at the end. Then to fix this, I changed the n-- to n - 1 and put hte decrement in the loop itself
